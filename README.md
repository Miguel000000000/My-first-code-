I'm a new programmer and I'm looking to improve. I don't know if I can call myself a programmer yet, but I'm studying and I'm going to dedicate myself as much as possible to reach my goal I'm trying to learn how to program on my cell phone, even with the cell phone's limitations, I'm going to start with it and I intend to find some way to buy a PC to advance in programming.
